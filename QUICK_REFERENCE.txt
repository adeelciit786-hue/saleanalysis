## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE FORECAST

**How It Works:**
```
1. Reads Nov & Dec sales data
2. Groups sales by weekday (all Mondays, all Tuesdays, etc.)
3. Calculates average for each weekday
4. Applies averages to January dates
5. Creates forecast for entire month
```

**Why It Works:**
- Sales patterns repeat weekly
- Mondays similar to other Mondays
- Weekends typically stronger
- Pattern is consistent
- Requires 2+ months to detect pattern

**Example:**
```
November Mondays: 100,000 + 105,000 = avg 102,500
December Mondays: 98,000 + 101,000 = avg 99,500
Average Mon: (102,500 + 99,500) / 2 = 101,000

January 1 is Monday → Forecast: 101,000
January 8 is Monday → Forecast: 101,000 (same pattern)
```

## 💾 DATA HANDLING

**What Happens to Your Files:**
1. You upload Excel file
2. App reads it (not modified)
3. Data stored in memory
4. File deleted from disk
5. Data lost when app closes

**For Permanent Storage:**
- Add database (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Enable "Save History"
- Export to Excel monthly
