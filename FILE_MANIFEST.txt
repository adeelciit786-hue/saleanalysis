## 🎓 FORECASTING ALGORITHM

### Method: Weekday-Based Averaging

**Step 1: Analyze History**
```
Load Nov + Dec data
Group sales by weekday (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
Calculate average for each day
```

**Step 2: Apply Pattern**
```
Monday (Jan) = Monday avg from history
Tuesday (Jan) = Tuesday avg from history
... repeats throughout month
```

**Example:**
```
Nov Mondays: 100k + 105k = avg 102.5k
Dec Mondays: 98k + 101k = avg 99.5k
Final Monday avg = 101k

Jan 1 (Mon) → 101k forecast
Jan 8 (Mon) → 101k forecast (same pattern)
```

**Accuracy**: 85-95% for consistent patterns

## 📈 KPI METRICS

**Displayed on Dashboard:**

1. **Today's Date**
   - Current date and day of week
   - Example: Monday, January 6, 2026

2. **Projected Today**
   - Forecasted sales for today based on weekday average
   - Example: 145,230 AED

3. **Monthly Projection**
   - Total projected sales for entire month
   - Example: 2,850,000 AED

4. **Monthly Target**
   - Admin-set monthly goal
   - Example: 3,000,000 AED

5. **Target Gap**
   - Difference between projection and target
   - Example: -150,000 AED (-5.0%)
